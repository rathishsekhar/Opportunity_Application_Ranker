# Introduction

The Streamlit application serves as a front-end interface for the Opportunity Application Ranker project, making it easier for users to see the end results the analysis. Users can change the model and parameters inside the code, and enter the details of the candidates to get the list of close jobs applicable to the candidate. Thus, demonstrating the Opportunity Application Project.
